        <p>We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) on our Services to collect and analyze

        <p>
            Third parties may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect 
            information about you as discussed above. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, 
            DoubleClick and others) may also serve tailored ads to you as you use the Internet and Internet-connected applications, and access 
            their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services to

            If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from 
            U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data 
            protection laws as your jurisdiction. As described above, we also may subcontract the processing of your data to, or otherwise 
            share your data with, other members within the MasterClass group of companies, service providers, and business partners in 
            countries other than your country of residence, including the United States, in accordance with applicable law. Such third 
            parties may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of Services to you, the processing of transactions and/or the 
            provision of support services. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use. 
            MasterClass will take reasonable and appropriate steps necessary to ensure that any third party who is acting as a “data 
            processor” under EU and Swiss terminology is processing the personal data we entrust to them in a manner that is consistent 
            with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles. MasterClass is potentially liable in cases of onward transfer to third 
            parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, respectively.
