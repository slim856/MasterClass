            <p><strong>3.2 Fees:</strong>To the extent the Service or any portion thereof is made available for any fee, you will be required 
                to select a payment plan and provide MasterClass information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You represent 
                and warrant to MasterClass that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly 
                update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) 
                that may occur. You agree to pay MasterClass the amount that is specified in the payment plan in accordance with the terms of such 
                plan and this Terms of Service. You hereby authorize MasterClass to bill your payment instrument in accordance with the terms of the 
                applicable payment plan until you terminate your account, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any 
                charges you must let MasterClass know within sixty (60) days after the date that MasterClass charges you. We reserve the right to 
                change MasterClass's prices. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to 
                pay the changed amount. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Services other than U.S. taxes based on MasterClass's 
                net income.
            </p>
            <p><strong>3.3 Recurring Subscriptions:</strong>If you select a Service with an auto renewal feature (“Recurring Subscription”), 
                you authorize MasterClass to maintain your account information and charge that account automatically upon the renewal of the 
                Service you choose with no further action required by you.  In the event that MasterClass is unable to charge your account as 
                authorized by you when you enrolled in a Recurring Subscription, MasterClass, may, in its sole discretion: (i) bill you for 
                your Service and suspend your access to the Service until payment is received, and/or (ii) seek to update your account information 
                through third party sources (i.e., your bank or a payment processor) to continue charging your account as authorized by you.
            </p>
            <p>MasterClass may change the price for Recurring Subscriptions from time to time and will communicate any price changes to 
                you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Recurring Subscriptions will take effect 
                at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept 
                the new price by continuing to use your Recurring Subscription after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with 
                the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling your Recurring Subscription before the price change 
                goes into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.
            </p>
            <p>Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. You may cancel a Recurring Subscription 
                at any time, but if you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription 
                fees already paid to us. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your 
                current subscription period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or 
                all of our users ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute 
                discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does 
                it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
            </p>
            <p>If you purchase any Service through a mobile purchase or third-party marketplace (e.g., through the Apple App Store or 
                Google Play Store), the refund policy applicable to that third-party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly 
                stated by MasterClass. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by MasterClass, the third-party marketplace will be solely 
                responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and MasterClass will have no refund obligations. MasterClass 
                disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third-party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's 
                compliance or noncompliance with such policy.

                your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify MasterClass of your infringement claim 
                in accordance with the procedure set forth below.

            <p><strong>4.5 Counter-Notice:</strong>If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) 
                is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to 
                the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following 
                information to the Copyright Agent: your physical or electronic signature; identification of the content that has been removed 
                or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

                of the content; and your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the 
                federal court located within Northern District of California and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person

            </p>
            <h3 class="terms-text">10. Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>You and MasterClass agree that these Terms of Service affect interstate commerce and that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act 
                governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section 10 is intended to be interpreted 
                broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any 
                aspect of the relationship between us or the Terms of Service or the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, 
                fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.  The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the 
                litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.
            </p>
            <p>If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at MasterClass, 
                660 4th Street #443, San Francisco, CA 94107 and <a href="mailto:support@masterclass.com">support@masterclass.com</a>, 
                and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute 
                relates to an account). Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best 
                efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations shall 
                be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>All disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or the Service that are not 
                resolved by the procedures identified above shall be resolved by individual (not group) binding arbitration to be 
                conducted before JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not 
                exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect 
                at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  
                If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, 
                unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. For residents outside the United States, 
                arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, and you and MasterClass agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction 
                of any federal or state court in San Francisco, California in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending 
                arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all 
                disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms 
                of Service, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Services are void or voidable, 
                or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available 
                in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be 
                entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>MasterClass shall bear the cost of any arbitration filing fees and arbitration fees for claims of up to $75,000, 
                unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs 
                that you may incur in the arbitration including but not limited to attorneys’ fees and expert witness costs unless 
                MasterClass is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.  If your claim is solely for 
                monetary relief of $10,000 or less, and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, you may choose 
                whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic 
                hearing, or by an in-person hearing.
            </p>
            <p>You and we agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a 
                class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek 
                relief on a class basis. YOU AND MASTERCLASS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS 
                INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 
                If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable 
                for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall 
                be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
            </p>
            <p>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by 
                sending written notice of your decision to opt out to MasterClass at the address identified in Section 14 below. 
                The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of (a) the “Date of Last Revision” date of these Terms of Service as 
                set forth above; or (b) your first date that you used the Services that contained any versions of the Terms of Service 
                that included this version of the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver, whichever is later. Otherwise you shall 
                be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration 
                provisions, MasterClass also will not be bound by them. If MasterClass changes this ‘Arbitration’ section after the date 
                you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service), you may reject 
                any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the 
                “Date of Last Revision” date above or in the date of MasterClass' email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting 
                any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and MasterClass in accordance with the 
                provisions of this section as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes 
                to these Terms of Service).
            </p>
            <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE ABOVE DISPUTE PROCEDURES SHALL BE YOUR SOLE REMEDY IN THE EVENT OF DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND 
                MASTERCLASS REGARDING ANY ASPECT OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING THE ENROLMENT PROCESS) AND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO LEAD 
                OR PARTICIPATE IN A LAWSUIT INVOLVING OTHER PERSONS, SUCH AS A CLASS ACTION.
            </p>
            <h3 class="terms-text">11. Termination</h3>
            <p>You agree that MasterClass, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the 
                Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of 
                use or if MasterClass believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of 
                Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, 
                may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. MasterClass may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue 
                providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service 
                under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that MasterClass 
                may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further 
                access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that MasterClass will not be liable to you or any third party for any 
                termination of your access to the Service.
            </p>
            <h3 class="terms-text">12. Disputes Between Users</h3>
            <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service and 
                MasterClass will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. MasterClass reserves the right, but has no 
                obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.
            </p>
            <h3 class="terms-text">13. General</h3>
            <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and MasterClass and govern your use of the Service, 
                superseding any prior agreements between you and MasterClass with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to 
                additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content 
                or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard 
                to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth in 
                Section 10 above, you and MasterClass agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and 
                federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. The failure of MasterClass to exercise or enforce 
                any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision 
                of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that 
                the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions 
                of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any 
                claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one 
                (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice 
                given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement 
                to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained 
                in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of MasterClass, but MasterClass may 
                assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service 
                are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. 
                Under no circumstances shall MasterClass be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly 
                from an event beyond its reasonable control. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or 
                other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
